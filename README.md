About Me

Hi Iâ€™m MÃ¡rio, a Researcher and University Professor with a passion for software engineering. I have started my career programming in Fortran IV using punched cards (yes, by the end of Jurassic era). I've done lot's of low level programming and went from Z80 assembly, into x86 up to RISC, until I found C. Today I don't program a lot, basically I use Python to perform some data manipulation. My research interest is on using Process Mining to understand how developers work.  

In my free time I do all kinds of stuff including mechanics (I've rebuilt a 1980 Corolla engine), heavy gardening (I've turned an abandoned plot into a eden garden) and of course all sort of domotics stuff using arduinos and raspeberry PI.
